## Code
The complete code both for date summarization and selection will be updated after the paper acceptance/conference presentation.

## Dataset CovidTLS
The data collection proposed in the paper could be easily reconstructed by using:
- The `data-sars-cov-2/list-URLs.tsv` file contains the pubdate and the link to the original documents, one per line (tab-separated-values)
- The `data-sars-cov-2/timeline.txt` contains the ground-truth timeline parsed from [covidreference website](https://covidreference.com/). It follows the [tilse](https://github.com/smartschat/tilse) ([tilse framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.07949.pdf) [tilse evaluation metric](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E17-2046.pdf)) annotation format.

## System Output
The folder `system_output` contains the best performing algorithm that can be used for performance comparison. The output for each benchmark data collection is stored separately in a dedicated folder (e.g., `system_output/TL17_bestds/` include the output timelines for the best performing method in date selection).
