But it remains to be seen whether Wolfowitz can overcome the derision and anger that have been heaped on him as the architect of the Iraq war .
It concludes : " The commission found no evidence of political pressure to influence the intelligence community 's prewar assessments of Iraq 's weapons programs .

In the few weeks before Bremer left Iraq , the CPA handed out more than $ 3bn in new contracts to be paid for with Iraqi funds and managed by the US embassy in Baghdad .

He wrote recently in the Guardian : ' There is little evidence that the world is a safer place , and a great deal more evidence that the Iraq war has provided a major distraction to the challenge posed by global terrorism and al-Qaeda .

One of the impressive aspects of the Butler report was the way his committee followed the intelligence trail into the attorney general 's office and assessed the degree to which it did or did not shape his advice to the prime minister 's group on Iraq and to the cabinet .
For me , Goldsmith 's March 2003 opinion on the legality of the Iraq war remains the fault-line under the Blair government .
" In his report , Lord Butler showed that the government 's fundamental shift in the spring of 2002 from a policy of containing Saddam Hussein to one designed " to enforce disarmament " was not based on any new development in the current intelligence picture on Iraq .

Elements of all these precedents can be traced in the research done on motivations of suicide bombers in Palestine , Chechnya and al-Qaida and probably now those in Iraq .
Suicide attacks also have historical precedent ; but what does seem new , first in Palestine and now in Iraq , has been the combination of the two and their frequency .
Even more closely related to Iraq 's suicide bombers is the fascinating description of early Christian martyrdom in Farhad Khosrokhavar 's new book , Suicide Bombers .

Fisk claims the insurgency in Iraq could have been avoided if America and Britain had heeded bin Laden five weeks before the 2003 invasion , when he made it clear that if it went ahead , he would encourage all Muslims to co-operate with Saddam 's Baath party against the Americans and British .
Meyer 's version of history is that he and the Foreign Office were soon jettisoned in favor of the superstar politicking to which Blair gravitated ; that , in the year leading up to the Iraq invasion , his embassy warned London of the defective plans Washington was making and its rudimentary notions of how the country would be administered after Saddam .
