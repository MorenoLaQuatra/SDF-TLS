But the market for cash among banks is global , and in Europe , government interventions have been unpredictable , with different countries taking different tacks to try to prevent a spiraling crisis in the financial system .
At 101 stories , the World Financial Center is China 's tallest building and a symbol of the country 's go-go economy .
That is , the government would take an ownership interest in the house just as it would take an ownership interest in the financial institutions that would be bailed out under the Treasury 's plan .
Yes , the government 's swift purchase of illiquid securities would stabilize compromised financial institutions and the credit markets .
With financial institutions de-leveraging and lending less , it will fall upon the government to invest more in the American economy -- to diminish the effects of the recession that is coming down the tracks and to build the kind of infrastructure that will enhance American competitiveness in a global economy .
The Singapore government , which through its massive sovereign wealth funds has increased its private equity and other financial holdings in recent years , has said it is looking to invest in more distressed assets in the United States .
The bailout plan 's political travails can be traced to its conception -- a three-page proposal for the Treasury secretary , who is the immediate past CEO of Wall Street 's most successful investment bank , to buy up financial institutions ' bad loans at prices he would set , with no oversight and no aid to anybody else .

In the midst of a global financial crisis , the world has come to China 's doorstep seeking leadership .
Leadership means setting an example and often entails political or economic sacrifice at home for the greater good abroad .
Our lack of good governance domestically has increased our vulnerability to food and product safety crises and precipitated a global financial crisis .
The global financial crisis , for example , has sparked calls for Beijing to take a greater stake in the International Monetary Fund .
In addition to developing the political capacity for leadership , the time Beijing spends getting its house in order would allow China to develop the economic wherewithal to lead .
The Brazilian auto industry 's ability to weather the downturn will test the assertions of those who say the country 's burgeoning and diversifying economy is better prepared to fend off a U.S.-generated crisis than in earlier years .
Yet all this tinkering at the margins has failed to reassure the Chinese people , or many outside the country , that the government has a clear plan for its political and economic future .

U.S. Seizes Control of AIG With $ 85 Billion Emergency Loan Invoking extraordinary powers granted after the 1929 stock market crash , the government seized control of the insurance giant American International Group to preserve a crucial bulwark of the global financial system .
Greed and fear , which routinely govern financial markets , have seeded this global crisis .
The U.S. is moving in dog years compared to Japan , " said Adam Posen , deputy director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former consultant to the U.S. government on the Japan crisis .
He said government officials have been in close contact with a number of other countries , including Sweden , which is credited by experts with comparatively deft handling of its financial crisis in the early 1990s .
American regulators have been actively seeking advice from Japan , hoping that a better understanding of its mistakes will aid them in navigating their own country 's financial crisis .
Regarding the Sept. 17 front-page article on the government bailout of American International Group ( AIG ) , which was published a day after the op-ed column " No More Creampuffs , " about the government being willing to let large firms fail : It seems to me that the market is not really free if oil companies get huge tax breaks and financial institutions such as Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and AIG know that the federal government will bail them out when they make stupid decisions .
Now , most financial firms also invest for themselves .

The U.S. financial system this weekend faced its gravest crisis in modern times , as regulators resorted to triage on Wall Street to contain the spreading damage from a meltdown in the housing and mortgage market .
Wall Street firms have been allowed to grow with relatively few restrictions ; the regulator that oversees their financial soundness , the Securities and Exchange Commission , is historically more focused on protecting investors than preventing a run on a bank .
Paulson has offered a blueprint to overhaul this financial regulation , and Congress plans to take it up next year .
Regulators of all stripes have had difficulty getting the information they need to fully understand the risks that financial firms are taking .
The titans of Wall Street have , over the past 72 hours , been forced to reckon with the reality that the financial sector they built is , in its current form , too big , uses too much borrowed money and creates too much risk for the broader economy .
Both McCain and Obama addressed the burgeoning economic crisis on the Trail yesterday .
Among the issues likely to be scrutinized : How much of a day -to-day role should the government and regulators take in financial markets ?

This is one of many eerie parallels that the current meltdown bears to the Great Depression , when Washington and the taxpayers had to step up and take unprecedented action to stabilize the financial markets and the economy .
I find it hard to stomach the fact that investment banks that caused this financial crisis immediately ran to the government asking for assistance , which Bear Stearns received and Lehman Brothers , thankfully , did not .
Emerging markets around the world suffered in the fallout of the U.S. financial crisis as access to credit evaporated and investors sold shares to cover losses elsewhere .
In the run-up to the millennium , the Federal Reserve , led by then-Chairman Alan Greenspan , began to pump money into the capital markets to deal with any financial problems that might arise from a Y2K meltdown .
Many investment professionals operating in my world believe , as do I , that we are facing the greatest financial crisis since 1929 .
Let 's hope that this influence fades rapidly -- and that this financial crisis does n't end the same way as the one of nearly 80 years ago .
With virtually no debt , a budget surplus and more than $ 550 billion in foreign currency reserves , as well as other reserve funds totaling at least $ 172 billion , the government has been able thus far to prevent a run on banks and contain the financial turmoil .

In decrying the lack of government regulation , Sarkozy joined a broad spectrum of European leaders and commentators who have interpreted the financial crisis as a death knell for the current financial markets and banking systems .
Their comments sometimes have betrayed an " I told you so " sentiment , after years during which U.S. officials suggested that many of Europe 's economic problems stemmed from an excess of regulation and government intervention .
The appropriate degree of state intervention in banking and financial dealings also has been a frequent subject of disagreement within the European Union .
" Sarkozy 's speech was described by aides as an attempt to reassure the French and other Europeans in the face of the sudden financial instability that threatens to aggravate an already bleak economic picture .
But beyond Europe , he said , the leaders of all the world 's major industrial powers should gather at a special summit before the end of the year and start to construct from scratch a new financial and monetary framework to replace the U.S.-dominated system set up at Bretton Woods , N.H. , in 1944 .
The hour-long address , to a receptive audience of political supporters in this Mediterranean seaport , also seemed designed to project Sarkozy as an innovator taking the initiative with fellow world leaders rather than submitting to a crisis that he said originated on Wall Street and unfurled across the Atlantic because of inadequate government regulation .
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany , usually a stalwart ally of President Bush , also has derided the lack of regulation that , in her view , allowed the financial crisis to erupt in the United States and seep toward Europe .

Obama should attempt to link the current Wall Street crisis to the McCain\/Bush proposal to privatize social security .
There are few people who would dispute that this bill is directly linked to the current financial crisis .
Obama the self-serving , corrupt campaigner who is going around blasting hyperventilated , fear-stimulating talk trying to create an economic-fear-vote to help his campaign , is the kind of person who can cause the public to panic & a needed financial correction to shake out bad investment banks & let them fail , turn into a panicked loss of confidence and widespread failures .
McCain enthusastically supported this bill , his ( former ) chief economic advisor Phil Gramm was one of
The crisis that has seized Wall Street over the last few days caught the campaigns of both Barack Obama and John McCain flat-footed .
Yet another liberal dope writes : " that Phil Gram caused the subprime mortgage crisis , with his bill to ease banking regulations

Yes , there has been serious moral failure that has led to this economic wreckage and moral failure requires accountability .
In what ways did I buy into an economic model completely built upon greater and greater consumption - a system in which our ever expanding desires far too easily are turned into needs ?
Obviously , some people are guiltier than others for this economic crisis but in an interdependent reality all are responsible .
And I guess the basic religious and spiritual notions of accountability and taking responsibility have been annulled with regard to financial leaders and their institutions that need to be " saved " .
What about last Monday 's fundamentally strong economy versus yesterday 's extreme crisis ?
If he felt the crisis was so important he could have suspended his campaign last week or Monday , Tuesday even Wednesday .
But no great moral or spiritual insight is required to know that the moral failure that has led to our present crisis is as old as human beings - in a word GREED and it would be far too easy for any " us " to simply blame some other " them " and thereby deflect and project our responsibility on someone else .

But as Robert Dugger , an economist and partner in a leading hedge fund likes to points out , the markets have only just begun to force some financial discipline on the majority of U.S. households that relied on borrowed money to maintain their lifestyles .
Now , some Democrats want to create a new agency that would use money borrowed by the Treasury to recapitalize troubled financial institutions by buying some of their unwanted loans and securities at discounted prices .
The frenetic pace of the financial crisis has forced the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve to make rapid-fire decisions in recent days , leaving Capitol Hill lawmakers effectively impotent -- and frustrated .
And by acting as an intermediary , the Treasury and the Federal Reserve have shown a newfound willingness to use those funds to keep the housing market and the financial system from totally collapsing .

Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. has adapted the Treasury 's traditional powers to deal with the financial crisis .

An interesting comparison can be made between Hurricane Katrina and the current financial crisis , which symbolically has now stranded a number of rich investors on the roofs of their mansions , crying out to the government to be rescued .
Debates about the competitiveness of U.S. financial markets will focus less on how little regulated they are and more on how much protection and transparency they offer to investors .
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. acknowledged that the federal government 's previous policy of addressing corporate failures on a case-by-case basis had not stemmed the accelerating crisis .
Paulson and Bernanke held a morning conference call with more than 100 House Republicans , making the case for their plan and describing in " strong and serious " terms the dire situation facing the financial system , according to a participant on the call .

Crooked mortgage brokers , greedy investment bankers , oblivious rating agencies and gullible investors have all been faulted in the financial crisis , and there is bipartisan agreement that regulators were asleep at the switch .
The problem is that Wall Street and regulators relied on complex mathematical models that told financial institutions how much risk they were taking at any given time .
Financial systems overall have emergent properties that are not conspicuous in their individual components and that traditional risk management does not account for .

This unprecedented intrusion of government is coming in the waning days of the administration of a Republican president who made privatization , deregulation and a faith in free markets the centerpiece of his economic policies and of his political agenda .
Financial Rescues Show That Faith in Free Market Is Shaken Self-reliance .
As with the Great Depression , it has taken a full-blown financial crisis to shake the faith that free markets will always deliver better outcomes than politicians and bureaucrats .
It will be several years , and probably several more rescues and interventions , before the crisis has subsided .
But even after the economy has recovered and financial markets return to normal , a generation of Americans that has lived through the savings-and-loan crisis of the '80s , the Internet bubble of the '90s and the current credit crisis is likely to retain both a lingering suspicion of unregulated markets and a willingness to use the powers and resources of government to enhance economic stability .
Which is why it is so extraordinary that the government now finds itself hip-deep in the direct management of the financial system , rescuing four of the country 's biggest financial institutions -- Bear Stearns , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and now Lehman Brothers -- from the harsh discipline of markets and the consequences of their own misjudgments .
These are qualities that have been as central to the national identity as they have been to the American economic model .

George Will , columnist , put it this way yesterday : Under the pressure of the financial crisis , one presidential candidate is behaving like a flustered rookie playing in a league too high .

patriot needs to demand that John McCain debate Barack Obama and tell the American people how he is going to fix this economic catastrophe that he ( John McCain ) , Bush , and the past Republican controlled congress created .

Now a well-paid executive at a Swiss bank , Gramm cochairs Sen. John McCain 's presidential campaign and advises the Republican candidate on economic matters .
McCain ca n't do anything in Washington to solve this economic crises .
Interesting ... because it was the democrats who forced these financial institutions to give loans to those beyond their means .
There is a whole gang of senators , congressmen , and financial heavyweights in Washington who can do all the work needed to solve the problem without McCain 's presence .

" I will continue to work with congressional leaders to find a way forward to pass a comprehensive plan to stabilize our financial system and protect the American people by limiting the prospects of further deterioration in our economy , " he said .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke , along with Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. , had urged Congress to pass legislation that would allow the government to buy bad debt such as mortgage loans from financial firms .
He described the Sept. 30 notice , which allows some banks to keep more money by lowering their taxes , as a way to help financial institutions during a time of economic crisis .
And they will come around , reluctantly , to the understanding that the only way to get out of these situations is to have governments all around the world borrow gobs of money and effectively nationalize large swaths of the financial system so it can be restructured , recapitalized , reformed and returned to private ownership once the crisis has passed and the economy has gotten back on its feet .

We should be open to thinking about a new set of financial arrangements -- a better financial democracy -- that can restore the public 's faith in the economic principles espoused by Washington more than two centuries ago .
The current crisis does not mean the end of American capitalism .
The current crisis offers us a singular opportunity to reevaluate fundamentally the safety and permanence of the master financial institutions that we have come to take for granted as part of the national economic landscape .
The near-collapse of the U.S. financial system and Washington 's sudden and massive intervention to try to shore it up certainly mark a major turning point , but a bailout would represent a thoroughly American next step for our economic system -- and one that will probably lead to better times .
This means developing better markets that will allow us to hedge against the kinds of risks that dragged us into this crisis , such as real estate gambles .
It has become fashionable to fret that the current crisis on Wall Street marks the end of American capitalism as we know it . "
This is entirely in keeping with our basic principles -- as long as the bailout promotes , rather than hinders , financial democracy .

Boykin Curry , a New York fund manager , points out that " 30 percent of S&P 500 profits last year were earned by financial firms , and U.S. consumers were spending $ 800 billion more than they earned every year .
The monetary authorities also need to remain committed to pumping liquidity into the financial system as long as credit markets and interbank lending remain weak .

The U.S. government is dramatically escalating its response to the financial crisis by planning to invest $ 250 billion in the country 's banks , forcing nine of the largest to accept a Treasury stake in what amounts to a partial nationalization .
Fears about the global crisis helped Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's Conservative Party gain seats in Tuesday 's vote .

I hope you wo n't think it petty to point out that some of the people who this past weekend were complaining that the Treasury secretary was being too timid in his response to the financial crisis were some of the same people who , three weeks ago , were complaining about his audacity in demanding a " $ 700 billion blank check .
After being steeped in frustration and fear for nearly two weeks , investors and traders seemed more confident in global efforts to stem the financial crisis .

Washington Post Book Club : Friedman , Ehrenreich , Singletary on the Financial Crisis
By Shailagh Murray and Paul Kane TOLEDO , Ohio -- Determined to keep the campaign spotlight on the economy , Sen. Barack Obama added $ 60 billion in new tax breaks and other benefits to his economic stimulus plan , and urged Congress to act quickly after the election to provide middle-class relief .
In a momentous meeting yesterday afternoon in Washington , Paulson , flanked by top financial regulators , told the executives of nine leading banks that they needed to participate in the program for the good of the national economy , two industry sources said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly .
This is not an economic policy ; this is pandering with empty promises that are , at best , going to accomplish nothing and , more likely , only going to hurt the nation in the end .
Forcing banks to hold on to mortgages that should have been in foreclosure months ago just prolongs the debt\/credit crisis , and cutting taxes and breaking the cookie jar of retirement funds is no way to cut back and save for the future .
Senator Obama knows that the economy is going to need economic stimulus to get out of recession .

Airlines Brace for Impact of Crisis Delta Air Lines chief executive Richard Anderson and other executives said the carrier was somewhat insulated from the economic downturn .
What might FDR say in a fireside chat during the financial crisis of 2008 ?
In our time of financial crisis , when everyone from the President to the world 's richest person is telling us we 're near the abyss , it 's worth hearing what a previous president said when Americans actually were in the abyss .
The financial crisis has just confirmed that the average american can no longer sit on the sidelines and hope their 401K investments will bail them out when they retire .
Most of the advice offered to solve the financial crisis has been based on the wrong diagnosis and has naturally offered the wrong remedy .
If there 's a silver lining to the current crisis , it 's that lots of sectors have gotten cheap at once .
He and other executives said Delta was more insulated from the economic slowdown because most of the airline 's growth has taken place in flights to and from Africa and the Middle East , away from the New York-to-London air corridor .

During times of economic crisis , some may be tempted to turn inward -- focusing on our problems here at home , while ignoring our interests around the world , " Bush said at a White House summit on international development in Washington .
The Web commentary was one of several posted by Taliban or al-Qaeda-allied groups in recent days that trumpeted the global financial crisis and predicted further decline for the United States and other Western powers .
The Bush administration , which has garnered accolades for dramatic increases in U.S. international aid programs , cut its foreign aid in 2007 by 3.5 percent , to $ 21.7 billion , according to the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development .
" The two major U.S. presidential candidates , Sens. John McCain ( R-Ariz . ) and Barack Obama ( D-Ill . ) , have suggested that the financial crisis would not curtail their ambitions for foreign aid .
The United Nations estimates that , even before the market crisis , rising food prices had pushed an additional 75 million people into chronic hunger , bringing the total to 925 million after years of decline .
Bush has argued against cutting such aid amid the global financial crisis .
Both the Bush administration and the two major presidential campaigns have rejected any suggestion that the economic downturn will undermine the country 's fight against al-Qaeda .

The economic crisis is giving the prosecution a boost in the case of Fixed Fee v. Billable Hours .
Countries can unilaterally establish swaps exchanges , and financial institutions all over the world can use them .
" Before the financial crisis happened , I thought in 10 years the billable hour would be on the way out .
The fix that rightly commands widest support is moving the swap contracts between financial institutions onto centralized exchanges , so the collapse of one large player does not threaten others that entered into swaps with it .
But it 's worth remembering that after the last global crisis , in 1997 - 98 , there was lots of grand talk about a new international financial architecture .
The second fix on most reformers ' lists is to shrink the pyramids of debt in the financial system .
Bretton Woods boosters assert that a global financial system needs global regulatory fixes .

To do this , we need cross-border supervision of financial institutions ; shared global standards for accounting and regulation ; a more responsible approach to executive remuneration that rewards hard work , effort and enterprise but not irresponsible risk-taking ; and the renewal of our international institutions to make them effective early-warning systems for the world economy .
We are living through the first financial crisis of this new global age .
TOKYO , Oct. 17 -- Fear of a deep global recession washed over Asian and European markets Thursday , and the financial crisis continued to shake major institutions .
It is important , too , that in the international leaders ' meeting that has been proposed we seek a world trade agreement and reject the beggar-thy-neighbor protectionism that has been a feature of past crises .
The old postwar international financial institutions are out of date .
" Today , the same sort of visionary internationalism is needed to resolve the crises and challenges of a different age .
At the end of World War II , American and European visionaries built a new international economic order and formed the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and a world trade body .

According to many Republican members of Congress , banking industry lobbyists and financial pundits , the Wall Street meltdown would not be nearly as bad as it is but for the baleful impact of " mark-to-market " accounting rules .
These are national standards , adopted in the wake of the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s , that require banks to carry certain financial assets on their books at the current market price .
INEVITABLY , PERHAPS , the deepening financial crisis has spawned a search for scapegoats and quick fixes .
In recent weeks , he has focused his message on the administration 's handling of the nation 's financial crisis , suggesting that the Treasury Department has been more interested in " bailing out the banks " than helping struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure .
To suspend or abandon mark-to-market now , in the middle of a panic , would simply deepen the confusion and suspicion that are already crippling the financial system .
Actually , complaints about the rule probably overstate its impact , since financial institutions only have to use it for securities they intend to trade .
Eight years later , this time running as the Republican presidential nominee , the senator from Arizona is again criticizing Bush and his financial policies , as he renews his efforts to demonstrate that he would represent a departure from the current administration .

But will its global status and role really , as the third theme claims , be strengthened by this Western economic crisis ?
His announcement means that Bush , who has already presided over the largest U.S. intervention into the financial markets in 75 years , may also leave a lasting imprint on the structure of the world economy .
Leaders from the United States , European countries and other economic powers gathered in Geneva this summer but could n't agree on a range of issues , including strengthening the global regulatory framework and agricultural tariffs .
The last big financial crisis -- in fact the biggest stock and real estate collapse -- to have occurred in any large industrial economy since 1929 was the one that began in Japan in 1990 - 91 .
Thanks to its capital controls , its savings surplus and its state-controlled banking system , China is well insulated from the Western financial crisis ( unlike India , where companies ' foreign debts are high and private banks are getting squeezed ) .
Barroso , speaking at Camp David , agreed that a " new global financial order " was needed .
The meetings would involve emerging economic powers previously excluded from similar talks as well as those that have dominated the global financial system over the last half century , White House officials said .

After the Asian financial crisis in 1998 , there was a lot of brave talk about updating the old Bretton Woods institutions , but petty politics and an improving economy got in the way , and nothing was ever done .
And now , through the marvels of global financial markets , they have spread their toxic culture and products to economies across the globe .
As they arrive in Washington , the challenge for global leaders is to find a way to tame a financial system that has not only corrupted American-style capitalism but also brought unwelcome instability to the global economy .
From the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s to the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s to the Internet craze at the turn of the century to today 's economic conflagration , the past 20 years have provided ample evidence that uncontrolled flows of private capital have created massive booms and busts that have overwhelmed the financial system and destabilized the global economy .
It 's not only a decisive moment for the economy , but it 's the most decisive moment for American-style capitalism since July 1944 , when , after 22 days of negotiation at a remote lodge in the White Mountains of New Hampshire , leaders of 44 nations emerged with the blueprint for a new world financial order based on the principles of free markets , free trade and the free flow of capital .
Creating a new architecture and regulatory framework for the global financial system is complicated and wonky and wo n't win anyone the next election .
As he sees it , the current crisis does not reflect any fundamental flaw in the American model but instead results from individual failures by lenders , borrowers , financial firms and regulators that can be minimized in the future , not through more regulation but through smarter regulation .

But countries need both to do more and to avoid gaps in their rescue programs by agreeing on how to handle cross-border loans and financial institutions that operate across jurisdictions .
While the consequences of financial crises are clearly international , the regulation of finance remains almost wholly national .
The United States , European Union and some others are moving rapidly to shore up their financial institutions .
McCain used the debate to promote another approach to solving the economic crisis , saying he would have the government buy up bad mortgages and renegotiate them at the current lower housing values , thereby allowing struggling homeowners to remain in their homes .
Although the Europeans rebuffed a recent U.S. initiative for a cooperative strategy and are having trouble getting their region-wide act together , it is too late to assign blame over responsibility for the crisis , within or among countries .
The Obama campaign called the mortgage idea " old news , " saying that a similar Treasury Department program is already underway as part of the economic rescue package and that Obama backed it .
Global oversight of both financial regulation and currencies can no longer be neglected .

Further legislation to deal with the economic crisis should not wait until the new president takes office .
The economy faces two separate problems : the downward spiral of home prices , which hangs over the financial markets , and the decline in aggregate spending , which could cause a deep and prolonged recession .
Previous attempts to use government spending to stimulate an economic recovery , particularly spending on infrastructure , have not been successful because of long legislative lags that delayed the spending until a recovery was well underway .
The writer , an economics professor at Harvard University and an adviser to the McCain campaign , is president emeritus of the National Bureau of Economic Research .

World economic leaders will gather in Washington Saturday for a summit to address the global financial crisis .
But many government and private terrorism experts say the financial crisis has given al-Qaeda an opening , and judging from public statements and intercepted communications , senior al-Qaeda leaders are elated by the West 's economic troubles , which they regard as a vindication of their efforts and a sign of the superpower 's weakness .
Intelligence officials are warning that the deepening global financial crisis could weaken fragile governments in the world 's most dangerous areas and undermine the ability of the United States and its allies to respond to a new wave of security threats .
One official accused Zoellick of trying to ensure that the major decisions on the financial crisis would be made by the less unwieldy Group of 20 nations , which met in Washington on Nov. 15 to try to coordinate international response to the meltdown .
A protracted financial crisis could threaten the survival of friendly regimes from Pakistan to the Middle East while forcing Western nations to cut spending on defense , intelligence and foreign aid , the sources said .
The crisis could also accelerate the shift to a more Asia-centric globe , as rising powers such as China gain more leverage over international financial institutions and greater influence in world capitals .
The underlying problems and trends -- especially regional instability and the waning influence of the West -- were already well established , but they are now " being accelerated by the current global financial crisis , " the nation 's top intelligence official , Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell , said in a recent speech .

Coming on top of all these challenges , the financial turmoil is bound to intensify skepticism about markets .
( Cnbc ) Washington Post columnist Steven Pearlstein says his columns last year about a then-looming crisis were often dismissed .
The claim that the financial crisis reflects Bush-McCain deregulation is not only nonsense .
" Post business columnist Steven Pearlstein , who won a Pulitzer Prize for columns last year warning about the magnitude of the coming crisis , says he was often dismissed as a pro-regulation zealot or gadfly critic of Alan Greenspan .
So blaming deregulation for the financial mess is misguided .
" It is not easy for journalists to take on the masters of the financial universe , especially when the market is going up and everyone is happy .
" We all failed , " CNBC correspondent Charlie Gasparino says of news outlets missing the danger signs of the current economic crisis .

There are two financial sectors where more extensive regulation might have made a difference .
If ever there was a company built to withstand the global financial crisis , Boeing might be it .
The only significant financial deregulation in the past three decades applied to commercial banks .
The savings-and-loan industry was subject to extensive regulation in the 1970s , but that did not prevent the subsequent crisis .
I hasten to add that had both financial sectors been subject to regulation ,
Regulation in itself is a weak defense against financial crises .

" It did n't work well mainly because this crisis originated in frightened financial markets .
And on Monday , most of them opted to stick to their faith , whatever the financial consequences for the nation .
The sale of Wachovia 's banking business to Citigroup yesterday marked the second time in five days that a major U.S. bank was forced from existence in part by fleeing depositors , raising serious questions about the stability of other financial firms and the health of the banking system .
A hallmark of the crisis has been the stark contrast between the " real economy " of production and jobs and the tumultuous financial markets of stocks , bonds , banks , money funds and the like .
Unfortunately , we lack experience with stabilizing financial markets , and the issue has been at the fringes of economics .
Massive losses on mortgage-related securities caused some financial institutions to fail .
As fear spread , financial institutions grew wary of dealing with each other because no one knew who was solvent and who was n't .

The financial world was fixated on Capitol Hill as Congress battled over the Bush administration 's request for a $ 700 billion bailout of the banking industry .
" The story of the obscure provision underscores what critics in Congress , academia and the legal profession warn are the dangers of the broad authority being exercised by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. in addressing the financial crisis .
Until the financial meltdown , its opponents thought it would be nearly impossible to revamp the section because this would look like a corporate giveaway , according to lobbyists .
The credit crisis has moved into trade finance as largely a funding problem .
It is a " lender of last resort " that provides credit lines when private financial markets are not lending .
Export credit agencies have helped mitigate a financial crisis before .
It is critical for global prosperity that trade financing -- be it keeping credit lines open , oiling the trade supply chain or direct funding -- remain vibrant during the financial crisis .

Robert B. Zoellick , president of the World Bank , said the global financial system may have reached a " tipping point " -- the moment when a crisis cascades into a full-blown meltdown and becomes extremely difficult for governments to contain .
During Tuesday 's debate , Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain ( Ariz. ) charged that the mortgage finance giants " lit this fire " under the economic crisis .
The crisis threatens to reverse years of prosperity that financed the economic growth in developed and emerging countries through a global financial system that made credit widely available .
But now , in the reverberations of the global financial crisis , Polonka Parkline itself has been put on hold , along with all of billionaire developer Sergei Polonsky 's projects , except those on which construction has already begun .
The impact of the crisis is clearest in real estate construction , one of the fastest-growing segments of the economy over the past few years but also one of the most heavily dependent on bank loans .
This article quoted World Bank President Robert B. Zoellick as saying the world financial system may have reached a " tipping point .

Fed Has Giant , and Opaque , Role in Financial Crisis Aid Wall Street analysts , congressional overseers and the media have parsed every detail of the Treasury Department 's financial rescue program -- $ 250 billion and counting .
Largely outside public view , however , the Federal Reserve is lending far more than that amount -- $ 893 billion , roughly the equivalent of the annual economic output of Mexico -- to help a wide range of institutions weather the economic storm .
The central bank is even fulfilling some of the original goals of the Treasury Department 's $ 700 billion rescue program by allowing financial institutions to use securities that are difficult to sell as collateral for loans .
" The existing system of lending is broken , " said David Shulman , a senior economist at the UCLA Anderson Forecast , which analyzes economic trends .
The expansion in Fed lending has come in the form of numerous new programs to inject cash into the financial system , attempts to combat a crisis in which banks and other firms are hoarding it .
Much of the remainder represents the new lending to banks and other financial institutions .
Even the weekly report that summarizes the Fed 's financial position has grown -- to eight pages from four pages a year ago .

Obama claims that " deregulation of the financial system , " championed by McCain , led to the economic crisis .
The financial crisis had its origins in an era of cheap credit that helped inflate housing prices .
On Thursday came the worst shock so far : The government seized the country 's largest bank , completing the emergency takeover of virtually the entire financial system .
Now we are facing more than just the adjustments of global imbalances problem since these imbalances have led to problems in our financial institutions .
If countries tackled these three items we would put the financial institutions back on a sounder footing and they could get lending going again , which would get consumers spending again and businesses investing again .
" Only a restoration of the system of checks and balances that once protected the American investor , and that has seriously deteriorated over the past 10 years , can restore the confidence that makes financial markets work , " McCain said in a 2002 speech . "

The Bush administration initially was n't enthusiastic about this weekend 's meeting of the Group of 20 nations to discuss the global financial crisis .
Financial institutions are continuing to sell assets in a falling market to meet capital requirements or other rules .
The most famous financial summit , the Bretton Woods gathering of 1944 , built upon this principle .
the arrival of China as a co-manager of global prosperity ; the new assertiveness of Europe in arguing for its own , Brussels-style transnational approach to financial regulation ; and the growing anger of developing economies such as Brazil , which feel caught in a downturn for which they had no responsibility .
Anger toward America for creating the financial contagion is a powerful , if largely unstated , theme .
A decade ago , when a country such as Brazil experienced a financial crisis , it was possible to blame bad Brazilian policy .
So the Bretton Woods architects created financial insurance in the form of the International Monetary Fund .
