But it remains to be seen whether Wolfowitz can overcome the derision and anger that have been heaped on him as the architect of the Iraq war .
It concludes : " The commission found no evidence of political pressure to influence the intelligence community 's prewar assessments of Iraq 's weapons programs .
" What this means is that the person who was the architect of the corporate-driven plan for Iraq that failed now gets a chance to do that in the rest of the world . "

Just as serious was the easy ride the Bush administration received from the mainstream media in the run-up to the Iraq war .
The New York Times famously bought into the line peddled by Ahmad Chalabi , the Iraqi exile , that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction .
The failure to challenge the administration before and after the Iraq war does not reflect well on the mainstream US media , which badly needs a few more Seymour Hershes to keep the spirit of Watergate reporting alive .

We 're talking about like how much money we 're putting into Iraq , " said Mr Kaufman , who worked on the clean-up of New York after the terrorist attacks of September 11 .
It emerges in the wake of 11 September and the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq , and more or less reflects that state of permanent war imagined by George Orwell , waged by a single authoritarian superpower .
The two rhetorical heavyweights clashed in a rousing debate on Iraq in New York , both landing painful political blows among the insults , although Mr Galloway , Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow , came unstuck when he referred to the September 11 attacks .

The auditors found that the CPA did n't keep accounts of the hundreds of millions of dollars of cash in its vault , had awarded contracts worth billions of dollars to American firms without tender , and had no idea what was happening to the money from the Development Fund for Iraq ( DFI ) , which was being spent by the interim Iraqi government ministries .
Officially , Iraq exported $ 10bn worth of oil in the first year of the American occupation .
In the few weeks before Bremer left Iraq , the CPA handed out more than $ 3bn in new contracts to be paid for with Iraqi funds and managed by the US embassy in Baghdad .

It has been the UK 's view that a violation of Iraq 's obligations under resolution 687 which is sufficiently serious to undermine the basis of the ceasefire can revive the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 .
The provisions relevant to determining whether or not Iraq has taken the final opportunity given by the Security Council are contained in OPs 4 , 11 and 12 of the resolution .
Lord Goldsmith 's full advice had concluded that the government would need " hard evidence " that Iraq was not cooperating with UN weapon inspectors if it was to argue it could go to war on the basis of past UN resolutions .

In December 2003 , Associated Press reported that " Iraq 's health ministry has ordered a halt to a count of civilians killed during the war " .
Well according to the Houston Chronicle , even Blair 's favorite data source , the Iraqi health ministry , reports that twice as many Iraqis - and most of them civilians - are being killed by US and UK forces as by insurgents .
Like Jack Straw , wriggling his way around the figures in a written ministerial statement , they compare it to the statistics compiled by the Iraqi health ministry and the website Iraq Body Count .

But , according to extracts from his confidential minute of March 7 , the attorney general warned Mr Blair : " The language of resolution 1441 ( the last UN resolution on Iraq before the war ) leaves the position unclear " ; " I remain of the opinion that the safest legal course would be to secure the adoption of a further resolution to authorise the use of force " ; " We would need to be able to demonstrate hard evidence of ( Iraqi ) non-compliance and non-cooperation " ; " In the light of the latest reporting by Unmovic ( UN weapons inspectors ) you will need to consider very carefully whether the evidence of non-cooperation and non-compliance by Iraq is sufficiently compelling to justify the conclusion that Iraq has failed to take its final opportunity " .
Lord Goldsmith 's confidential minute of March 7 said he could make a " reasonable case " for Britain to go to war with Iraq without a second UN resolution but a court " might well conclude " this course of action was illegal under international law .
On March 7 , the day Lord Goldsmith drew up his report , Mr Blix gave his final report and this was the most favourable yet from Iraq 's point of view .

Later today , George Bush will address an increasingly sceptical nation about Iraq , where sentiments have changed since the invasion two years ago .
" When my soldiers say to me and ask the question whether or not they 've got support from the American people or not , that worries me , and they are starting to do that . " About 40 % of the 135,000-strong US force in Iraq are reservists and National Guards , part-time soldiers who have civilian jobs and are not wedded to a military career .

At the end of the day , there are bigger questions about the war in Iraq than the role of Mr Galloway .
Unfortunately , the most talked-about aspect of ( the senate sub-committee hearings ) is Mr Galloway 's vitriolic attack on the integrity of ( chairman ) Norm Coleman and the sub-committee , his denunciation of the war to liberate Iraq and his assertions of persecution at the hands of Zionists , Christian fundamentalist and other alleged malefactors .

The idea of electorally established Shia dominance of Iraq deeply troubles Arab regimes , with or without Shias of their own .
It is obvious that all these regimes , like the Iraq insurgents themselves , hanker after a restoration of the old Sunni - or Ba'athist - dominated order , or even some Saddam-like figure to preside over it - or , at least , as King Abdullah once put it , " somebody with a military background who has experience of being a tough guy " .

Fisk claims the insurgency in Iraq could have been avoided if America and Britain had heeded bin Laden five weeks before the 2003 invasion , when he made it clear that if it went ahead , he would encourage all Muslims to co-operate with Saddam 's Baath party against the Americans and British .
Meyer 's version of history is that he and the Foreign Office were soon jettisoned in favor of the superstar politicking to which Blair gravitated ; that , in the year leading up to the Iraq invasion , his embassy warned London of the defective plans Washington was making and its rudimentary notions of how the country would be administered after Saddam .

It has become a commonplace to portray Cook 's opposition to the war on Iraq as one of great principle .
Probably his greatest Commons triumph was in the 1996 debate on the Scott Report into arms for Iraq .
He could have made his departing speech at the start of the crucial debate on Iraq , but allowed himself to be convinced by Campbell not to .

Elaina Morton is not listed as one of the 2,000 Americans now confirmed killed in Iraq since the start of the war , but she might as well be .
Deedy says her daughter , Chyna , 12 , was so angry with her father for going to Iraq and getting killed that she has only just begun to grieve .
According to Karen Spears Zacharias , who has set up a grassroots network linked to the website heromama.org for widows and the 1,200 children who have lost parents in Iraq , there is better support from the military than there was during the Vietnam era , when her father was killed .

More than 50 journalists and media workers have been killed in Iraq since the US-led invasion nearly two years ago .
Japan , a vocal backer of the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 , said it was optimistic .
The first full day after Iraq 's election results were announced saw three Iraqi troops die in a roadside bomb , two Baghdad police shot dead in a drive-by shooting , an oil pipeline detonated and a woman and child killed by a mortar attack .

Zawahiri also warned the US that " tens of thousands " of its military personnel would die if they did not immediately withdraw from Iraq and that continuation of US aggression against Muslims would make " you forget the horrible things in Vietnam and Afghanistan " .
And the team found the same trend for the statistics in Iraq since the coalition invasion in March , 2003 .
In today 's Guardian newspaper , the mayor of London , Ken Livingstone , argued that British troops should be withdrawn from Iraq to help protect the city from more attacks , because the invasion was " not justified " .

PM forced into pledge after outrage at killing of Italian officer Italy 's prime minister , Silvio Berlusconi , yesterday announced that he would begin withdrawing his country 's troops from Iraq in September under pressure from public opinion .
Mr Berlusconi dropped his bombshell last night hours af ter Italy 's lower house of parliament , in which the prime minister 's supporters have an outright majority , approved funding for its contingent in Iraq until the end of June .
In London , the government announced yesterday it was proposing an international conference on Iraq later this year to encourage the United Nations and other major organizations to kickstart the stalled reconstruction program .

It is essential for Bush and Blair to be able to say that staying the course in Iraq can disable or end the terrorism practiced by young Muslims in Europe and elsewhere .
Few today would seriously deny that the war in Iraq generates terrorist sympathies among members of Western Europe 's Muslim communities , as the Palestinian intifadas did .
It is necessary as the justification for the Bush administration 's war in Iraq .

This finding runs counter to the line from Downing Street , which has sought to detach Iraq from the London attacks .
Britain 's involvement in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan contributed to the terrorist attacks in London , a respected independent thinktank on foreign affairs , the Chatham House organization , says today .
Yesterday a government spokesman said the prime minister had told the cabinet that people who used Iraq to justify the London bombings had " a perverse view of Islam " .

The Iraq war in 2003 broke new constitutional ground in many ways , in particular because a British government for the first time allowed MPs a substantive vote on a war before it began .
But modern wars fought in modern democratic societies are increasingly posing new questions and demanding new rules , as the historic parliamentary vote in March 2003 over Iraq implied .
But it would be petty to see the bill as an excuse to rerun old arguments about Iraq .

Mr Blair had discredited himself and Britain in Muslim eyes by backing the Iraq war , Mr Mahathir said .
Like many political leaders who fought against the regime , he also commanded a militia - of about 1,000 men - which controlled a mountain area of north-eastern Iraq close to the Iranian border .
Reflecting the rage felt across the Muslim world over abuse scandals in Afghanistan and Guantnamo Bay , and continuing violence in Palestine and Iraq , Mr Mahathir said President George Bush and other US politicians were " ignorant " people who believed might made right - a return to colonial-era " old thinking " .

If Iraq is truly to become a democratic state , complying with international human rights treaties and conventions , then its constitution , while upholding sharia law , must ensure that its interpretation does not breach its international obligations .
Depriving women of their long-held rights and rendering them subservient to interpretations of Islamic law could well lead to the " Talibanisation " of Iraq and an escalation of violence towards women who rebel .
Iraqi women have campaigned and lobbied hard over the past few months , often risking great personal danger - several politically active women have been assassinated , abducted , raped or threatened - for the new constitution to guarantee women 's rights and abide by international treaties .

USA Today critic Robert Bianco said : " Setting a TV series in Iraq while the war still rages is a risky and , some have said , a presumptuous proposition . "
The television debut of a new Iraq war drama from the creator of Hill Street Blues , NYPD Blue and LA Law has proved highly controversial in the US .
But as concern about the validity of the war in Iraq grows in the US - only 43 % of Americans predict victory , although a majority believes the war is just , according to the latest Gallup poll - the show has provoked mixed reactions .

Elements of all these precedents can be traced in the research done on motivations of suicide bombers in Palestine , Chechnya and al-Qaida and probably now those in Iraq .
Suicide attacks also have historical precedent ; but what does seem new , first in Palestine and now in Iraq , has been the combination of the two and their frequency .
Even more closely related to Iraq 's suicide bombers is the fascinating description of early Christian martyrdom in Farhad Khosrokhavar 's new book , Suicide Bombers .

Officially , a similar process is under way in Iraq , with the Americans saying they will eventually hand over to the new Iraqi army - though the chances of that succeeding look even bleaker than they did in Vietnam .
There are four major issues : terrorism , Sunni-Shia rivalries , Kurdish aspirations , and the question of Iraq 's territorial integrity - all of which pose dangers internationally .
Professor van Creveld has previously drawn parallels between Iraq and Vietnam , and pointed out that almost all countries that have tried to fight similar wars during the last 60 years or so have ended up losing .

The war in Iraq has been high on the general election agenda for the past week , and the death of a soldier so close to polling day will add to the pressure on Tony Blair .
This is especially the case because the Liberal Democrats opposed the Iraq war , as this newspaper also did .
